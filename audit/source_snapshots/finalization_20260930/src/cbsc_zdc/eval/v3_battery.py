"""The v3 metric battery, wired to the frozen production validation bank.

Unit-tested metric functions that cannot consume the production validation bank
are not a battery.  `topology.py`, `correlations.py` and `diversity.py` have
been implemented and unit-tested since the v3 overlay landed, but nothing could
run them against real checkpoints, so the project could say its fidelity was bad
without being able to say *how*.  This module is the missing wiring.  It adds no
new metric formulas: every quantity is computed by the existing implementation.

Two properties matter more than the metric list.

**The evaluation bank is fixed and immutable.**  One manifest of exactly 10,000
validation conditions, selected by a documented deterministic digest order and
energy-stratified so every primary bin holds at least 500, hashed before any
checkpoint is evaluated, and reused byte-identically for every comparison.  A
battery that reselects its events per checkpoint measures the selection as much
as the model.

**It fails closed.**  Every input that can change a number -- checkpoint, frozen
config, event manifest, geometry, split hashes, seeds, bin definition, solver
steps, precision -- must be supplied explicitly or resolved from a hash-verified
frozen manifest.  Nothing defaults.  Constructing a test loader is fatal, not
discouraged.
